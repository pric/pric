Issue localhost development server certificates signed by own Private Certificate Authority in no time.

**Use !pric only for development on local hosts. For public hosts consider using [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)!**

## Introduction

Self-signed certificates cause trust errors and issuing locally-trusted development certificates signed by a real
Certificate Authority (CA) can be dangerous or even impossible for the hosts like `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`.

!pric automatically creates and installs a local CA in the system root store, and generates locally-trusted certificates.

## Usage

[Download !pric sources](https://github.com/pric/pric/archive/master.zip) via browser and unzip archive.

Or just download and untar it with terminal command:

```shell script
wget -c https://github.com/pric/pric/archive/master.tar.gz -O - | tar -xz
```

Go to the extracted `pric-master` directory and execute `pric.sh` terminal command:

```shell script
sh pric.sh
```

This command will:

1. Generate Certificate Authority private key in `/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/!pric/ca.key`
2. Generate Certificate Authority self-signed certificate in `/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/!pric/ca.crt`
3. Update operating system Certificate Authority registry
4. Generate localhost private key in `./output/localhost.key`
5. Generate localhost certificate signing request in `./output/localhost.csr`
6. Generate localhost certificate signed by Certificate Authority in `./output/localhost.crt`
7. Compile PEM file in `~/localhost-certificate.pem` (required for [Reverse proxy for PHP built-in server](https://github.com/mpyw/php-hyper-builtin-server))

Terminal output:

### Tested on

- Ubuntu
- CentOS
- macOS

### Import Certificate Authority to browser

#### Firefox

1. Go to `about:preferences` in address bar.
2. Search for `Certificates` and click `View Cerficicates` button.
3. In `Authorities` tab click `Import` and choose `/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/!pric/ca.crt` certificate.

`!pric` Certificate Authority will be added to the list.

#### Chromium (Chrome)

1. Go to `chrome://settings/certificates` in address bar.
2. In `Authorities` tab click `Import` and choose `/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/!pric/ca.crt` certificate.

`org-!pric` Certificate Authority will be added to the list.

## Customization

By default `!pric` creates certificate for the following domain names:

- `localhost`
- `test.localhost`
- `*.test.localhost` (wildcard)

This list could be changed in `./openssl.dns.cnf` file (`!pric` creates missing config file on start).

## Verify Certificate Working

Run web development server on 4000 port and try to access it via cURL:

```shell script
$ curl -v https://localhost:4000

* Rebuilt URL to: https://localhost:4000/
*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 4000 (#0)
